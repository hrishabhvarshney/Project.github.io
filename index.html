                <h2>An Indian Revolutionary</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Chandra Shekhar Tiwari </b>, popularly known as <b>Chandra Shekhar Azad</b>, was an Indian revolutionary who reorganised 
                    the <b>Hindustan Republican Association</b> (HRA) under its new name of <b>Hindustan Socialist Republican Association</b> 
                    (HSRA) after the death of its founder, Ram Prasad Bismil, and three other prominent party leaders, Roshan Singh, Rajendra 
                    Nath Lahiri and Ashfaqulla Khan. He hailed from Bardarka village in Unnao district of United Provinces and his parents were 
                    Sitaram Tiwari and Jagrani Devi. He often used the pseudonym <b>"Balraj"</b> while signing pamphlets issued as the 
                    commander-in-chief of the HSRA.

                <h2>Early life and career</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Chandra Shekhar Azad</b> was born on 23 July 1906 in Bhabhra village as Chandra Shekhar Tiwari, in a Brahmin family, in 
                    the princely-state of <b>Alirajpur</b>. His forefathers were from Badarka village of Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh. His 
                    mother, Jagrani Devi, was the third wife of Sitaram Tiwari, whose previous wives had died young. After the birth of their 
                    first son, Sukhdev, in Badarka, the family moved to Alirajpur State.
                    His mother wanted her son to be a great Sanskrit scholar and persuaded his father to send him to Kashi Vidyapeeth at Benares 
                    to study. In 1921, when the Non-Cooperation Movement was at its height, Chandra Shekhar, then a 15-year-old student, joined. 
                    As a result, he was arrested on 20 December. On being presented before the Parsi district magistrate Justice M. P. Khareghat 
                    a week later, he gave his name as "Azad" (The Free), his father's name as "Swatantrata" (Independence) and his residence as 
                    "Jail". The angered magistrate punished him with 15 lashes.

                            Mahatma Gandhi suspended the Non-Cooperation movement in February 1922 as a result of the Chauri-Chaura incident,
